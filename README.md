The Eudoxus API is aiming for the convenience of the University Students to choose and receive their canon books from different bookshops without logging in the Eudoxus Information System. Gaining access in the Eudoxus System takes too much time for the University Students to select and search their canon books and some times they will be entagled by the procedure!

Let's make our lifes easier!
